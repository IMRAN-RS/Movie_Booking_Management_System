# Movie Booking Management System
Create a movie booking management system like BookMyShow to allow a user to search and book movie tickets.


BookMyShow is India's biggest online movie and events ticketing brand. The website caters to ticket sales for movies, plays, concerts and sporting events via the online platform.

BookMyShow is an online ticketing facility like Movietickets.com, Explara and Ticketmaster.com. BookMyShow took the primary services provided by these two websites and consolidated it into one website for movies, plays, events and sports tickets. Apart from being an online ticketing portal, BookMyShow offers information about upcoming movies and events, show timings, venue details and artist bios.
